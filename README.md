This dataset contains agricultural data focused on various crop yields across different countries and years. It includes important environmental and agronomic variables such as average rainfall (mm per year), pesticide usage (tonnes), and average temperature (Â°C), along with categorical attributes like country (Area) and crop type (Item). The target variable, hg/ha_yield, represents crop productivity measured in hectograms per hectare. This diverse set of features allows for in-depth analysis of how environmental conditions and farming practices impact crop yields over time and across regions. The dataset is well-suited for building predictive models to support agricultural planning and policy-making.
